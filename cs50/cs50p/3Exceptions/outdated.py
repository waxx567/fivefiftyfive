# In the United States, dates are typically formatted in month-day-year order (MM/DD/YYYY),
# otherwise known as middle-endian order, which is arguably bad design. Dates in that format
# can’t be easily sorted because the date’s year comes last instead of first. Try sorting, for
# instance, 2/2/1800, 3/3/1900, and 1/1/2000 chronologically in any program (e.g., a spreadsheet).
# Dates in that format are also ambiguous. Harvard was founded on September 8, 1636,
# but 9/8/1636 could also be interpreted as August 9, 1636!

# Fortunately, computers tend to use ISO 8601, an international standard that prescribes that dates
# should be formatted in year-month-day (YYYY-MM-DD) order, no matter the country, formatting years
# with four digits, months with two digits, and days with two digits, “padding” each with leading zeroes as needed.

# In a file called outdated.py, implement a program that prompts the user for a date, anno Domini,
# in month-day-year order, formatted like 9/8/1636 or September 8, 1636, wherein the month in the
# latter might be any of the values in the list below:

months = [
    "January",
    "February",
    "March",
    "April",
    "May",
    "June",
    "July",
    "August",
    "September",
    "October",
    "November",
    "December",
]

# Then output that same date in YYYY-MM-DD format. If the user’s input is not a valid date
# in either format, prompt the user again. Assume that every month has no more than 31 days;
# no need to validate whether a month has 28, 29, 30, or 31 days.
