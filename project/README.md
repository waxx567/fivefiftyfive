Followed Kevin Powell on Scrimba coding this Frontend Mentor challenge and used that as a template:

I chose this as a template because I had built the original Space Tourism challenge copying the Figma design following along with this video, and I had appreciated the functionality as well as the accessibility options.

Added Flask functionality for routing

Still to do:
