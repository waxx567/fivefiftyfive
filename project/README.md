How I got here:

This is the final project for my Harvard CS50 course. I had originally planned on using the homepage I designed for problem set 8, adding database functionality.

Didn't like the basic look of that project for this one so I changed things.

Followed Kevin Powell on Scrimba coding this Frontend Mentor challenge and used that as a template:

https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/space-tourism-multipage-website-gRWj1URZ3

I chose this as a template because I had built the original Space Tourism challenge copying the Figma design following along with this video, and I had appreciated the functionality as well as the accessibility options for assisted technologies.

Added Flask functionality for routing and connecting to MySQL database

These are the tables I created in the users.db database:

CREATE TABLE contact (
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
contact_name TEXT NOT NULL,
contact_email TEXT NOT NULL,
contact_message TEXT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE newsletter (
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
newsletter_email TEXT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE user (
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
user_name TEXT NOT NULL,
password_hash TEXT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE blog (
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
blog_title TEXT NOT NULL,
blog_user TEXT NOT NULL,
content TEXT NOT NULL,
replies INTEGER NOT NULL,
likes INTEGER NOT NULL
);
