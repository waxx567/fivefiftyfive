How I got here:

This is the final project for my Harvard CS50 course. I had originally planned on using the homepage I designed for an earlier problem set, adding database functionality.

Didn't like the basic look of that project for this one so I changed things.

Followed Kevin Powell on Scrimba coding this Frontend Mentor challenge and used that as a template:

I chose this as a template because I had built the original Space Tourism challenge copying the Figma design following along with this video, and I had appreciated the functionality as well as the accessibility options for assisted technologies.

Added Flask functionality for routing and connecting to MySQL database
