In this Python code, we define a Flask route at /weather that accepts a GET request with a city parameter in the query string. We then use the requests library to send a request to the OpenWeatherMap API with the specified city and our API key, and retrieve the response data as a JSON object.

We extract the relevant weather data from the JSON object and return it as a JSON response.
